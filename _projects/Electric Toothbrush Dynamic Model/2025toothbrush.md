2025 Electric Toothbrush

This project designs and models an electric toothbrush using a DC motor, gear train,
and MATLAB simulations of the electrical and mechanical dynamics. We analyze startup
behavior, response to torque disturbances, and discuss design tradeoffs such as inertia,
damping, and load torque.
